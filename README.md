- CytoBioAI - Biology Intelligence for Cell Regeneration**

-- App Description

```
CytoBioAI is an AI-powered platform revolutionizing cell therapy and regenerative medicine. It is powered by Gemini API (VertexAI, gemini-1.5-pro and gemini-1.5-flash), augmented with our proprietary research data on stem cell culture and organoid tissue engineering. The app accepts multi-modality inputs including microscopy images, electro-physiology and single-cell RNA sequence data.  I created embeddings and stored them in Firestore as the VectorDB to support semantic search. The App predicts phenotypes and differentiation outcomes, accelerating the development of groundbreaking treatments. Leveraging insights from human heart organoid research, CytoBioAI applied LLM/VectorDB to transforming healthcare through cutting-edge cell-based therapies.  The target users are bio-researchers, biochemists.  For example, the output of the predictions and semantic search demonstrated its ability to generate CiPA E14/S7B assay suitable for FDA submission.
